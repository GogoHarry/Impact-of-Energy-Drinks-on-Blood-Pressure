Energy drinks are widely consumed, particularly among young adults and adolescents.  While the effects of caffeine on blood pressure are known, energy drinks contain a combination of stimulants and other ingredients that may have a greater impact than caffeine alone. This project aims to investigate the impact of Redbull energy drinks on blood pressure.

### Data Source
The primary data used for this analysis is the Redbull.csv file, gotten from kaggle, containing blood pressure information before and after the consumption of the Redbull energy drink.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning and analysis
  - [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- PowerBI - creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Checking duplicates and missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:

- Does energy drink consumption lead to a significant increase or decrease in blood pressure?

- Is there a difference in the blood pressure between the male and female gender?

- Are specific age groups more susceptible to blood pressure changes from energy drinks?

### Key Results/Findings

- **Overall Blood Pressure increased by 9% After Consuming Redbull**
  - The overall data indicates a significant increase in blood pressure after consuming Redbull, suggesting a notable impact on cardiovascular health.
  
  Before: 156 mmHg
  
  After: 171 mmHg
  
  Percentage Increased: 9%

- **Men Experienced Higher Blood Pressure Increased at 9.5% Compared to Women at 8.6%**
  - Both genders experienced an increase in blood pressure, with males showing a slightly higher increase compared to females

- **Middle-aged adults (46-59) Show the Highest Increased Blood Pressure at 9.9%**
  - The analysis shows that all age groups experienced an increase in blood pressure, with the 46-59 age group seeing the highest percentage of increase at 9.9%
 
### Conclusion

The analysis clearly shows that Redbull consumption leads to a significant increase in blood pressure across all demographics studied.
These findings underscore the importance of monitoring cardiovascular response to energy drinks

### Recommendations

- **Raise awareness**: Public health awareness should be raised about the potential health risks associated with energy drink consumption, particularly regarding blood pressure.
- **Promote responsible consumption**: Responsible consumption of energy drinks should be promoted, especially among young adults and adolescents.
- **Account for health conditions**: Further studies should be conducted that account for pre-existing health conditions that might influence blood pressure response to energy drinks.

### Data Limitations

- The analysis used a limited sample size from the Redbull.csv file. This does not represent the entire population consuming energy drinks.

- The results cannot be generalizable to all energy drinks as the study only focused on Redbull.

- The study design cannot establish causality. While the analysis shows a correlation between Redbull and increased blood pressure, it cannot definitively prove Redbull causes the increase.

- The analysis did not account for the potential effects of other ingredients besides caffeine present in energy drinks.
